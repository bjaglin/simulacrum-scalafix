This project began as an experiment in rewriting Typelevel [Simulacrum][simulacrum] as a set of
[Scalafix][scalafix] rules. It's currently still a proof-of-concept, but it is able to replace
Simulacrum 1 in the [Cats][cats] repository without breaking any tests or binary-compatibility checks.

Please see [this Cats issue](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/3192) for discussion about this experiment.

Development of this tool has been supported by [Permutive][permutive]. Please see our [monthly
reports][permutive-medium] for updates on the work of the Permutive Community Engineering team.

## Simulacrum rules

Simulacrum 1's `@typeclass` macro annotation adds three kinds of boilerplate, which this project
factors into three Scalafix rules:

* `AddSerializable`: This rule adds `extends Serializable` to the root type classes in a type class hierarchy.
* `AddImplicitNotFound`: This rule adds custom `@implicitNotFound` annotations for type classes.
* `TypeClassSupport`: This rule adds a summoner method and syntax method support to the type class companion object.

## Dotty compatibility rules

This repo currently includes a few miscellaneous Scalafix rules that may be useful for experimenting
with Dotty cross-compilation:

* `ExpandPolymorphicLambdas`: This rule rewrites kind-projector's polymorphic lambda values to
  explicit anonymous class instantiations that work on both Scala 2 and Dotty.
* `ExpandTypeLambdas`: This rule rewrites (a large subset of) [kind-projector][kind-projector]'s
  type lambda syntax to a representation that currently works on both Scala 2 and Dotty.
* `ParenthesizeLambdaParamWithType`: This rule parenthesizes lambda parameters with type annotations
  as needed.

The first rule [may be used in Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/3193)—it's not yet clear
whether the polymorphic SAM support that may eventually be added to Dotty will support
cross-building there.

The latter two rules should no longer be necessary in most cases, since Dotty
[now supports][dotty-kind-projector] a subset of kind-projector's syntax via the `-Ykind-projector`
compiler option, and can add parentheses to lambda parameters with type annotations with
`-language:Scala2Compat -rewrite`.


## Building Cats without macro annotations

It's not currently possible to build Cats with [Dotty][dotty] because Simulacrum 1 uses macro
annotations, which Dotty doesn't support. The goal of this project is to change that by providing a
non-macro-annotation-based version of Simulacrum.

I have a Cats [branch](https://github.com/travisbrown/cats/tree/demo/simulacrum-scalafix) that
demonstrates how these Scalafix rules work. You can follow along with the following steps:

1. Add Scalafix and the locally-published Scalafix rules to the Cats build and remove Simulacrum 1, Macro Paradise, etc.
   This takes [about eight lines](https://github.com/travisbrown/cats/commit/4f6d5c25892e5b07c57b1a8980eb8fc9d0869dae)
   of configuration.
2. Add `@noop` annotations to `FlatMap#ifM`, `Functor#ifF`, and `Monad#whileM` and `whileM_`.
   [This](https://github.com/travisbrown/cats/commit/69d91a0d4ec5987132b936ad6b24351dbd2ee3f8) is necessary for
   compatibility because Simulacrum 1 didn't handle these methods.
3. Open an sbt console in the Cats repo and run the following commands:
   ```
   sbt:cats> scalafix AddSerializable
   sbt:cats> scalafix AddImplicitNotFound
   sbt:cats> scalafix TypeClassSupport
   sbt:cats> scalafmtAll
   ```
   This will result in [some boilerplate](https://github.com/travisbrown/cats/commit/a891d38104bfcc585b22a2c8ed65602fb4e13155) being added to the Cats source files:
   ```
   50 files changed, 2461 insertions(+), 17 deletions(-)
   ```
4. Run `sbt validateJVM` to verify that tests and binary-compatibility checks pass after the change
   (and `sbt ++2.13.1 buildJVM` if you want to check Scala 2.13 as well).

## Cross-building cats-core on Dotty

The instructions below are not up-to-date with Cats master, although they should still work.
Please follow [this work-in-progress PR](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/3269) for the
current status of Dotty cross-building.

You can add Dotty cross-building with a few additional steps:

1. Add build configuration for Dotty. This is [a net couple dozen lines](https://github.com/travisbrown/cats/commit/53165d502d03e5e8f8555a89aad066ebcb9eb943).
2. [Move](https://github.com/travisbrown/cats/commit/f304311574ec05d16f4cf8139bffc9e64c833829) the one macro definition in cats-core into a Scala 2-specific source directory tree.
3. Expand type lambdas and polymorphic function value definitions with the following commands:
   ```
   sbt:cats> +scalafix ExpandTypeLambdas
   sbt:cats> +scalafix ExpandPolymorphicLambdas
   sbt:cats> +scalafmtAll
   ```
   This will result in [a pretty big diff](https://github.com/travisbrown/cats/commit/ef1c4824564a5660e0faa54b8a05e934136d84ac).
   Unlike the similar Simulacrum boilerplate expansion we did above, this kind-projector expansion
   probably isn't something we'd ever want to merge—it's just a convenient way to try out Dotty
   cross-building.
4. Add [a couple of casts](https://github.com/travisbrown/cats/commit/0ba32c7f873a59f3088d54ac6751e3a0aa0c952a) that Dotty needs for some reason.
5. Compile on Dotty:
   ```
   sbt:cats> ++0.21.0-bin-20191201-65a404f-NIGHTLY
   sbt:cats> coreJVM/compile
   sbt:cats> kernelLawsJVM/compile
   sbt:cats> alleycatsCoreJVM/compile
   ```
   These modules should compile without errors (the other laws modules and cats-free will currently fail).
